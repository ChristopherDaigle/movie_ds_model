# Movie Data Analysis
This repository is related to data science work I have done around movie data (ratings, revenue, etc.) 

---
## Motivation
My current portfolio consists of no media related projects; I’m interested in data science applied to media (e.g. movies, music, etc.). I wanted to get familiar with connecting to a public API to scrape data and I wanted to start a basic examination of movie data; hopefully having the data useful for further work.
